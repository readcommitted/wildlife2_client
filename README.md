# 🐾 Wildlife Image Processing & Semantic Search System 🐾

The **Wildlife Image Processing & Semantic Search System** is a prototype platform for organizing, identifying, and exploring wildlife imagery using modern AI models, geospatial analysis, and semantic search.

This project combines **computer vision**, **location data**, and **embeddings** to help wildlife enthusiasts, researchers, and photographers document species, discover ecological patterns, and build richer digital field notes.

## ✨ Current Features

- ✅ **Species identification** using CLIP-based embeddings  
- ✅ **Regional species filtering** based on ecoregion boundaries  
- ✅ **Smart similarity search** with text prompts  
- ✅ **Location-aware ranking** to prioritize species likely present  
- ✅ **Image metadata extraction & geolocation** (via EXIF + OSM)  
- ✅ **Interactive Streamlit UI** for ingestion, validation, and analysis  
- ✅ **UMAP visualization tools** for exploring embedding space  
- ✅ **Early-stage SpeciesNet support** for wildlife classification
