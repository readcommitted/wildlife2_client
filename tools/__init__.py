__init__.py â€” Package Initialization File
-----------------------------------------

This file marks the directory as a Python package.

Although intentionally left empty, its presence allows Python to recognize the folder
as part of the module structure. This enables organized imports, relative paths,
and modular code organization within the Wildlife Vision System project.

No initialization logic is required at this level.
